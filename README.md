# The 5,000 Dollar Script 🚀

A simple bash script to install the Zorin "Pro" creative suite of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) applications via Flatpak.

## The Philosophy
Zorin OS Pro charges a fee to pre-install a curated list of applications, claiming it replaces over **$5,000** of professional software. While supporting developers is great, the software itself is—and always has been—free. 

This script allows users on **Zorin OS Core**, Linux Mint, Fedora, or any other distro with Flatpak support to install that same professional-grade suite with a single command. Use your money to donate directly to the individual projects (like Blender, Krita, or Kdenlive) instead.

## A small, but notable note

This does ***NOT*** magically give you the desktop layouts in Zorin Pro, just the FOSS apps that are alternatives to proprietary software that Zorin sells as "alternatives to
over $5,000 of professional software".
