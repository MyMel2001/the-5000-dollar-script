## 🛠 Contributing
Since Flatpak IDs change as projects move domains (e.g., FreeCAD moving from freecadweb to its own domain), this script is a living document.

If you notice a broken link or a new "Pro" app that Zorin has added to their list:
1. Open an Issue with the updated ID.
2. Submit a Pull Request with the corrected bash array.
3. Keep the "Spite Logic" intact.

Let's keep the $5,000 suite free for everyone.
